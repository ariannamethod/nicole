# Tweet Draft for @karpathy

## Version 1 (Technical & Direct)
@karpathy Working on "weightless transformers" - no pretrained weights, ephemeral models that spawn per conversation. Facing interesting constraints around knowledge persistence vs. purity of approach. Would value your thoughts on the tradeoffs.

## Version 2 (Specific Question)
@karpathy Building transformers without pretrained weights (spawn/dissolve per conversation). The constraint: how to handle domain knowledge without weights? Currently using runtime RAG + autonomous learning cycles. Is there a more elegant approach you'd recommend?

## Version 3 (Concise)
@karpathy Experimenting with weightless transformers (no pretrained weights, ephemeral per-conversation models). Curious about your perspective on the fundamental constraints this approach creates.

## Version 4 (Context + Question)
@karpathy Built a system where transformers have no pretrained weights - each spawns fresh per conversation. Trying to balance purity of the approach vs practical knowledge needs. Have you encountered similar architectural constraints worth considering?

## Recommended: Version 3
- Most concise and respectful of his time
- Asks for perspective without prescribing what you're looking for
- Links to repo for those interested
- Doesn't oversell the project
